def check_consecutive_numbers(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 2):

This is a function definition named check_consecutive_numbers that takes a list lst as an argument.
The function iterates over the indices of the list lst using the range(len(lst) - 2) expression. 
The -2 ensures that we don't go out of bounds while comparing consecutive elements.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element lst[i] plus 1 is equal to the next element lst[i+1], and 
if the next element plus 1 is equal to the element after that (lst[i+2]).
If the condition is true for any triplet of consecutive numbers, it returns True.
If the loop completes without finding any consecutive numbers, it returns False.

    positions = []
    for i, lst in enumerate(list_of_lists):

    return positions
This is another function definition named find_consecutive_numbers_lists that takes a list of lists list_of_lists as an argument.
It initializes an empty list called positions to store the positions and corresponding lists with three consecutive numbers.
It iterates over the list_of_lists using the enumerate function, which provides both the index i and the list lst.
For each list lst, it calls the check_consecutive_numbers function to determine if it contains three consecutive numbers.
If the condition is true, it appends a tuple (i, lst) to the positions list, representing the position and the corresponding list.
Finally, it returns the positions list.


list_of_lists = [[27,9,2,8,8,9,27,8],[1,18,18,18,19,4,4,1],[1,5,5,5,8,7,4,5],[1,2,3,5,8,4,4,3],[18,27,63,36,27,27,27,1,5],[3,5,8,4,4,4,2,15,15,151]]
This line defines a variable named list_of_lists and assigns it a list of lists. Each inner list represents a sequence of numbers.
python
Copy code
consecutive_positions = find_consecutive_numbers_lists(list_of_lists)
This line calls the find_consecutive_numbers_lists function with the list_of_lists as an argument and 
assigns the result to the variable consecutive_positions.
The variable consecutive_positions will contain the positions and corresponding lists that have three consecutive numbers.


for position, lst in consecutive_positions:
    print(f"List at position {position}: {lst}")
This is a for loop that iterates over each tuple (position, lst) in the consecutive_positions list.
For each tuple, it prints a formatted string that displays the position and the corresponding list.
So, when you run this code, it will find and print the positions and
lists that contain three consecutive numbers from the given list_of_lists
